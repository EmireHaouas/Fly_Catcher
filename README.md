information based on a flight number and date. It allows users to access real-time
data including departure and arrival airports, terminals, gates, flight status,
delays, aircraft model, and exact timing.The application is built entirely
with React and Vite, styled with custom CSS, and powered by the AviationStack 
API. It’s designed for clarity and responsiveness, giving users a clean and
efficient way to track their flight’s progress and logistics.
